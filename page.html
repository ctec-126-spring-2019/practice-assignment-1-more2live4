        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Amy. I feel like I have worn many hats in my life and fulfilled many roles. Some of my
            favorites are: mom, helper, teacher, author, adventurer, and student. I love learning and am motivated most
            when
            I feel challenged. I also tend to procrastinate at times, but am working hard all the time to improve.
        </p>
        <h2>Expectations</h2>
        <p>I hope to gain knowledge, insight, and a real understanding of computer programming. I would like to learn
            how
            much I really don't know. I know I have barely begun to fall down the rabbit hole, and I'm excited to see
            where
            I land.</p>
        <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
        <p>Programming languages I have previously learned:
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Though they are not true "languages," I have also taken a class in HTML5/CSS3</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
